#Project 3: A MAZE

**Name:** Rich Barr

**Time to complete project:** +100 hours, with much iteration

**Enjoyed:** Adapting the skybox and prefabs in photoshop and experimenting with the flocking algorithm. Building the particle system for the fountain. Experimenting with audio.

**Challenging:** 
Creating the initial layout for the maze and building the walls using the prefabs. Getting the code to work so that the door animated after the key was collected but not before the door was clicked (and making sure the door lock sound was not activated when the key was collected)

***Notes*
I could not work out how to prevent the birds from passing through the terrain in the scene.
I only baked the scene at 40 texels per unit. 80 texels produced over 125 lightmaps and seemed too exccessive.
Classical music only used for the purpose of this exercise as I did not have the time to create a soundtrack.

App built with Unity 5.5.0f3 using the gvr-unity-sdk-1.0.3 and tested on the Google Pixel XL
